# Leave Management System â€“ Frontend

## Overview

This is the frontend application for the Leave Management System. It is built with React and provides a modern, user-friendly interface for employees and managers to manage leave requests, approvals, balances, and user profiles.

The frontend communicates with the backend microservices via the API Gateway.

## Features

- User authentication (email/password & Google OAuth2)
